                  <h3>Using Spiritual Gifts:</h3>
                  <p>
                    Spiritual gifts are discussed in detail in four New
                    Testament passages: Romans 12:3-8; First Corinthians
                    12:1-10, 28-31; Ephesians 4:11, 12; and 1 Peter 4:10-11. Now
                    to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the
                    common good. 8To one there is given through the Spirit a
                    message of wisdom, to another a message of knowledge by
                    means of the same Spirit, 9to another faith by the same
                    Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, 10to
                    another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another
                    distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in
                    different kinds of tongues, a and to still another the
                    interpretation of tongues.(1 Cor 12:7-10). Spiritual gifts
                    are those gifts given by the Spirit of God for the
                    accomplishment of God’s purpose in the world and for the
                    edification of the church, the body of Christ. Two things
                    are important to remember concerning spiritual gifts: (1)
                    every believer has been given spiritual gifts; and the gifts
                    belong to God and are given for the believer to use for the
                    glory of God.

                  <h3>Serving:</h3>
                  <p>
                    God intended that the Christian life should be dynamic, not
                    static. We should sit under the teaching of the Word of God,
                    understand and apply its meaning and implications, and serve
                    God and our fellow believers. The Spirit of God has given us
                    spiritual gifts, but those gifts are worthless unless they
                    are put to use in the service of God and His church. Paul
                    often uses the figure of the human body to show the
                    dependence of the members of the body upon one another and
                    the importance of each member serving the other. While some
                    members of the body have more prominent places of service
                    than others, all are equally important. The worst thing that
                    can happen to the human body is for one of its members to
                    become nonfunctioning. Paralysis, sickness, deterioration,
                    and sometimes death occur when a body member ceases to serve
                    the other members of the body in the particular way that God
                    intended. To maintain strength, health, and vitality, every
                    member of the bod must function and serve all the other
                    members of the body. This is also true of the spiritual or
                    new life. We will grow in the new life, become strong, and
                    maintain good spiritual health as we use the talents and
                    abilities that God has given us to meet the needs of the
                    other members of the body.

                  <h3>Giving:</h3>
                  <p>
                    There is no better indicator of growth in the new life than
                    in the area of giving. 2 Corinthians 9:6-8 deals with the
                    attitude one should have in giving – it should be cheerful.
                    When giving is cheerful, it will also be generous. The
                    important rule of thumb is not how much is given, but how
                    much is left after the giving. God is not primarily occupied
                    with the amount of the gift, but with the motive that lies
                    behind it. All the money in the world belongs to God. My
                    gift to Him does not make Him any richer; it make me richer
                    spiritually because of the realization that everything I
                    have is His and that I am giving because I love Him and work
                    to give. The formula for giving is found in 1 Cor 16:2 where
                    three principles can be seen: (1) m giving is to be regular,
                    ‘on the first day of the week’; (2) m giving is to be
                    systematic, ‘let each one of you lay something aside’ and
                    (3) my giving is to be proportionate, ‘as he may prosper.’

                  <h3>The offices of the Church:</h3>
                  <p>
                    The New Testament uses four terms to describe the leadership
                    of the church (1) ‘elder’ which places emphasis upon the
                    authority that the leadership has to teach or rule in the
                    church; (2) ‘bishop’, which emphasizes the fact that the
                    leadership is charged with overseeing the local church and
                    as such is responsible for the spiritual well-being of those
                    in the church; (3) ‘pastor’ which places emphasis upon the
                    responsibility of the leadership of the church to shepherd
                    the flock. No shepherd has ever given birth to his sheep. It
                    is the responsibility of those in leadership to do for the
                    sheep what they cannot do for themselves and to make sure
                    that they are in good condition so that they can do what
                    comes naturally, that is, beget other sheep; (4) “deacon”
                    which places emphasis upon the attitude that the leaders are
                    to have in their leading. They are not to ‘lord it over’ the
                    flock, but are to realize that they are the ministers or
                    servants of those whom the Lord has put under their care.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The function of the office of elder is twofold: (1) teaching
                    and (2) ruling. An elder is to be able to teach his people
                    what the Word of God teaches and to give direction as to how
                    that is to be accomplished I and through the local church.
                    The qualifications for the office of deacon are essentially
                    the same as those for the elder except that the deacon need
                    not be ‘able to teach.’ The deacons are to be spiritual and
                    in tune with the elders and seek to assist them in
                    implementing the goals that the elders feel the Spirit of
                    God is leading them to pursue through the local church.{" "}

                  <h3>Sharing our Faith:</h3>
                  <p>
                    Sharing our faith is a combination of spontaneous
                    conversation about God and premeditated ideas about the
                    gospel. The following is asset of practical steps to take in
                    witnessing for Christ:{" "}
                  </p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Regularly talk about god. Sprinkle your ordinary
                      conversation with occasional references to god’s activity
                      in your life. It is much easier to share your faith when
                      your friends know God is an integral part of your affairs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Prepare our testimony. Learn to describe your
                      pre-Christian life, your encounter with Christ, and
                      sub-sequent changes in your life in fewer than 5 minutes.
                      If you became a Christian as a child, focus on the impact
                      Christ has had on your adult life.{" "}
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Learn a brief summary of the gospel. If you have never
                      learned a gospel presentation, ask your pastor to help you
                      find one. Perhaps he will assist you to master it.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    When you have opportunity to share Christ with someone, be
                    sensitive to that person’s spiritual readiness. God as far
                    as you can in the progression of mentioning the Lord,
                    telling your story of faith, presenting the gospel, and
                    appealing for a commitment of faith in Christ. Often you
                    will sense that your friend has heard all he or she wants
                    to. When you stop, be sure to mention that you want to talk
                    more about the Lord another time. Keep the subject open.{" "}

                  <h3>Our responsibility to Human Government:</h3>
                  <p>
                    It is impossible for a believer to be a good Christian and a
                    bad citizen at the same time. As children of God our
                    responsibility to human government is threefold.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      We are to recognize and accept that the powers that be are
                      ordained by God. “Let every should be subject to the
                      governing authorities. For there is no authority except
                      from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by
                      God.’ (Rom 13:1). This truth applies even to atheistic
                      human governments unless, of course, the law is
                      anti-scriptural. In that situation the believer must obey
                      God rather than humans (Acts 4:18-20). In fact, when Paul
                      wrote those words in Rom 13:1, the evil emperor Nero was
                      on the throne.{" "}
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      We are to pay our taxes to human government (Rom 13:7)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      We are to pray for the leaders in human government.
                      ‘Therefore, I exhort first of all that supplications,
                      prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for
                      all men, for kings and all who are in authority, that we
                      may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and
                      reverence. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of
                      god our Savior (1 Tim 2:1-3).
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    Paul exhorts us to pray for those who are in authority that
                    we may lead a quiet life. We are to pray that they hold
                    their offices in godliness and honesty.{" "}
