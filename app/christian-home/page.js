                    The threefold responsibility of an earthly father is (1) to
                    have God’s truth govern his heart – there must be heart
                    reality, not mere external conformity or ceremony; (2) to
                    have God’s truth govern his home – this is evidenced by the
                    fact that the father teaches the truths of God’s revelation
                    to his children by both formal (teach diligently) and
                    informal (talk to them) instruction; and (3) to have God’s
                    truth govern his habits and conduct personally, privately
                    and publicly. In short, the home is to be a divine school in
                    which the father is to be the teacher, under Christ.

                  <h3>The Role of the Wife</h3>
                  <p>
                    1 Peter 3:1-6 describes “subjection” to her husband as a
                    fundamental responsibility of the married woman. The wife is
                    to submit to the authority of her husband, not to men in
                    general. This does not mean the wife is by nature inferior
                    to the husband. In marriage two people become one through
                    the joining of their intellects, their emotions, and their
                    wills. To keep their special union from fracturing and
                    destroying itself, one member is charged to lead and one to
                    submit. The wife’s submission to her husband is her
                    “adorning, which makes her truly beautiful. This inner
                    beauty is of great value in God’s sight. The believing women
                    of the Old Testament who hoped to be the human channel for
                    the Messiah to come into the world made themselves beautiful
                    by being in subjection to their own husbands. This is
                    supremely illustrated in the relationship between Sarah and
                    Abraham. Wives are exhorted to do what Sarah did, to be in
                    subjection to their husbands, letting the consequences rest
                    with God, and thus become Sarah’s daughters. For the wife
                    who will do this God promises that if her husband is either
                    an unbeliever or out of fellowship with God, her subjection
                    can be the very means God will use to bring her husband into
                    a proper relationship with God. The wife’s submission may
                    lead to the husband’s salvation.

                  <h3>The Role of the Husband:</h3>
                  <p>
                    Paul tells the husband to love his wife (Eph 5:25), while
                    Peter tells the husband to dwell together with his wife (1
                    Peter 3:7). The husband cannot live with his wife as Peter
                    says unless he loves her in the way Paul means. The love
                    that the husband is commanded to have for the wife is not
                    primarily sexual or emotional (though both of those concepts
                    are involved); it is a love that loves in spite of the
                    response (or lack of it) in the one loved. It is the kind of
                    love that God has for the world and is the fruit of the
                    Spirit. A husband can only love his wife properly if he is a
                    Christian and under the control of the holy Spirit. The two
                    responsibilities the husband has in the family are to dwell
                    with his wife according to knowledge and to render to his
                    wife the honor that is due her because she is his wife. To
                    “Dwell together” with his wife means that the husband must
                    take his wife into every aspect of his life. There are to be
                    no areas of his life where there are signs that say,
                    “Private, husband only – wife keep out.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The husband is to perform his two duties for a spiritual
                    purpose: “that your prayers be not hindered.” The man who is
                    not taking his wife into every aspect of his life and
                    rendering to her the honor that is due her because she is
                    his wife cannot communicate with her in the way that God
                    intended; hence, he cannot communicate with God either. To
                    make sure that the channel of communication with God is
                    open, the husband must make sure that the channel of
                    communication with his wife is open. Only in this way can he
                    truly love his wife as God intended and manifest his
                    headship properly.{" "}

                  <h3>The Role of the Children:</h3>
                  <p>
                    Both the Old Testament and the New Testament agree that
                    children (till they becomes adults) have only one
                    responsibility in the family – to obey their parents. The
                    admonition of Solomon is more fully explained by Paul in
                    Ephesians 6:1-3: “Children, obey your parents in the Lord,
                    for this is right. “Honor your father and mother,’ which is
                    the first commandment with promise: ‘that it may be well
                    with you and you may live long on the earth.’ “Children” is
                    an inclusive term. It is not a matter of either sex or age
                    that is involved. God’s will for children is that they are
                    to obey their parents. The expression ‘in the Lord’ does not
                    limit the responsibility only to the circumstances where the
                    parents are believers. Col 3:20 clearly points out that
                    children are to obey their parents ‘in all things”, not just
                    in those things pertaining to Christian living. “In the
                    Lord’ more properly is understood to mean by the Lord or
                    because it is the Lord’s directive (that is what God says
                    children are to do). ‘For this is right’ indicates that for
                    children to obey their parents is righteous or Godlike. Such
                    obedience is perfectly illustrated by God the Son who was
                    completely obedient ot God the Father, even though that
                    obedience resulted in His death.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Two things are promised to children who obey their parents:
                    it will be well with them – they will have a happy life; and
                    they will have a long life. These are the two things that
                    children want most, and obedience to parents is the only way
                    to assure them. That is why this is the first commandment
                    with promise; from it springs all the other important issues
                    of life. Children who have not learned to obey their
                    parents, who are God’s representatives in the family, will
                    not learn to obey God.

                  <h3>The Role of the Parents:</h3>
                  <p>
                    While fathers are identified as the parents responsible for
                    setting the pattern for child rearing, others usually do
                    much more of the training and instructing of families’
                    children. Mothers and fathers need to agree on their
                    approach to child rearing and support one another in their
                    efforts with their children. Both parents are to be obeyed
                    and honored equally by their children. Parental
                    responsibility is set out in two ways: First what they are
                    not do – ‘do not provoke your children to wrath.’ Parents
                    are not to over discipline in a reign of terror that will
                    result in bitterly hostile children or children who give up
                    on life (Col 3:21). Second, what parents are to do – “but
                    bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord.”
                    To ‘bring them up’ involves three ideas:{" "}

                    <li>
                      Parenting is a continuous job. As long as a child is a
                      dependent, parents are responsible for rearing them so
                      they become the people God wants them to be.{" "}
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Parenting is a loving job. To ‘bring up’ means literally
                      ‘to nourish tenderly.’ Children should be objects of
                      tender, loving care.{" "}
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Parenting is a two-fold job involving 1) nurture (lit.,
                      ‘child training’) – all that children need for physical,
                      mental, and spiritual development – and 2) admonition
                      (lit., ‘corrective’ discipline of the Lord.)
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    Fathers and mothers are God’s constituted home authority to
                    nurture children along godly paths and to admonish them away
                    from ungodly ones. Fathers and mothers who do not discipline
                    their children are parents who are themselves undisciplined
                    and disobedient to God’s will.{" "}
