                      <p>
                        God created us in His own image to have an abundant
                        life. He did not make us as robots to automatically love
                        and obey Him. God gave us a will and a freedom of
                        choice.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We chose to disobey God and go our own willful way. We
                        still make this choice today. This results in separation
                        from God.
