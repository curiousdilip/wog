                    I was born in Chennai (then called Madras), in South India
                    in December 1969. My father was a Pastor of Arcot Lutheran
                    Church (ALC Chennai and nearby districts) and my mother
                    worked as a teacher in a government-run school,
                    Tiruvannamalai (near Chennai). I have an elder brother and
                    an elder sister who are leading their own lives along with
                    their families. My father served ALC for nearly four decades
                    and was well-known for his walking the extra mile for people
                    in need. He had his ministry internship at Peace Evangelical
                    Lutheran Church, Philadelphia, US (1970-71) and later taught
                    Christian ministry and Pastoralia at the Tamil Nadu
                    Theological Seminary, Madurai (1982-85). Alongside his
                    pastoral calling, with deep personal interest, he ministered
                    to the gypsies (Narikuravars/Vagiris) in Tiruvannamalai and
                    nearby districts for over three decades.{" "}

                    My mother came from the mainline Church of South India
                    background, from Bangalore, but knew God just in her mind
                    and neither led a life of regular prayer nor was hospitable
                    to the congregation. Mother suffered from complex emotional
                    breakdowns, hated my father and us, children. She was
                    ruthlessly judgmental, and used to humiliate us to any level
                    in order to ensure that we were no “problem kids!” At
                    school, though teachers were generally talented, the
                    educational system was arcane, with a third-class syllabus,
                    that neither inspired you nor was promising to take you
                    anywhere up in life.

                    With this backdrop, my childhood prayers were not for my own
                    development or my future, but for peace and quietness at
                    home. In April 1980, as a school boy, I attended a massive
                    open-air evangelistic meeting in Cuddalore, South India held
                    by renowned non-denominational healing preacher, Brother
                    Dhinakaran. I deeply felt that I needed a Savior for my
                    troubled home and a redeemer of my soul. I confessed my sins
                    to the Lord Jesus and surrendered my life. I got a
                    reassuring feeling that God heard my prayers. I felt a
                    newness in my heart and a surge of courage to live
                    differently than other boys in School. With the
                    encouragement of my father, I began reading the Bible and
                    Christian books and magazines. I came to believe that God
                    saved me by His grace and through creating in me a living
                    faith. I came to know that I am saved not BY works but FOR
                    works of faith as His witness in a fallen world. As per
                    church’s teaching, I began confessing with meaning the
                    Apostolic creed of faith, every Sunday. An elder friend of
                    my father – Brother Darling Samuel took personal interest in
                    me and led me to a deeper understanding of the Bible, by
                    hours of conversations. Another friend of my father (Brother
                    Augustine Joseph), counseled me on how to deal with
                    temptations and youthful sins and prayed for me that I will
                    ever have a closer walk with the Lord, in holiness.

                    As college life began, I continued my regular study of the
                    Bible and prayers in solitude of my hostel room. I found God
                    strengthening me through His promises in the Bible. I found
                    the love of the Heavenly Father, who called me from darkness
                    to light. I found God’s grace in Christ Jesus who has been
                    interceding for me, being seated at the right hand of the
                    heavenly Father. I found the joy of Salvation through the
                    sweet communion of the Holy Spirit, by attending spiritual
                    conventions as and when possible. I began to share about my
                    faith life to fellow students at the chapel and at student
                    bible study groups, small fellowships, and later in
                    churches. I began writing articles in local church
                    bulletins.

                    In Oct 1999, God led me to marry a God-fearing young woman
                    Sharmilee, from Andhra Pradesh. She was greatly guided by
                    her mother in knowing the Lord intimately and to worship Him
                    by her personal devotions and prayers. Sharmilee has been
                    greatly helpful in my humble ministry engagements, for over
                    two decades, while I have been in secular jobs in the
                    development sector and of late, had served in a regional
                    institute of the United Nations.

                    I am sharing this testimony to encourage people who question
                    God’s ways in their lives. Look beyond your depressing
                    circumstances for a better tomorrow, as the Good Shepherd
                    can lead you from shame to glory. Irrespective of your
                    family or religious background if you surrender your life to
                    the Lord Jesus Christ, by confessing your sins and turning
                    away from them, you can see His faithfulness in forgiving
                    you and granting His gift of Salvation, where life will
                    assume fuller meaning. Your journey of faith will be
                    purpose-driven with the enabling grace of God, liberating
                    truth of the Bible and the leading of the Holy spirit. May
                    God bless you to taste and see in life, that He is good!
