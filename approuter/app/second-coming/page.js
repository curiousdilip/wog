                    (Taken from Chapter 12 of the book: A Visual Survey of the
                    Bible, by David L. Dawson)

                  <p>
                    Concerning these future matters, there is general agreement
                    on the central issues. These include such things as:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      History will go on to a certain point, then God will
                      intervene.
                    </li>
                    <li>There will be a tribulation.</li>
                    <li>
                      There will be a rapture in which God’s people will meet
                      the Lord Jesus in the air.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      At Jesus’ return in power the Antichrist will be
                      destroyed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      There will be a final crushing of all opposition to
                      Christ.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      There is a judgment that results in each person spending
                      eternity in heaven or hell.
                    </li>
                    <li>There will be an eternal state of heaven or hell.</li>

                    How one arranges the details of the fulfillment of the
                    promise to Abraham depends on his views as to:{" "}
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      {" "}
                      Whether the yet-unfulfilled Old Testament promises are to
                      be fulfilled to the physical descendants of Abraham (the
                      Jews), or the spiritual descendants of Abraham (the
                      Church, made up of Jews and Gentiles).{" "}
                    </li>

                      {" "}
                      Whether the 1,000-year reign of Christ — the Millennium —
                      described in Revelation 20 is to be taken as a literal
                      1,000-year reign of Christ on earth, or as a symbol of the
                      complete rule Christ now exercises over heaven and earth,
                      and which He will exercise until He returns to destroy all
                      opposition.

                    There are basically two forms of Premillennialism held among
                    evangelical scholars (Dispensational and Historic).{" "}

                  <h3>Dispensational Premillennialism</h3>
                  <p>
                    Adherents of this position believe that the promises God
                    gave to Abraham were made literally to him and to his
                    physical seed, the nation of Israel. Those promises which
                    are yet unfulfilled will one day be fulfilled to Israel
                    during a future 1,000-year reign of Christ on the earth.
                    During this reign, Israel as a nation will have a special
                    status in the world. The Jews will have returned to Christ
                    and will have been converted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This belief holds that the end time events will occur as
                    follows:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      The Church will be raptured out of the world to meet the
                      Lord in the air prior to the period of tribulation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      There will be a seven-year period of tribulation on the
                      earth which is the “Seventieth Week” of Daniel’s vision.
                      It is described for us in Daniel 9 — especially verse 27.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      At the end of the tribulation, Jesus will return to earth
                      in His second coming. The saints will return with Him and
                      will reign with Christ for 1,000 years on the earth.
                      During this Millennial reign, Satan will be bound, and
                      Christ will rule from David’s throne. Israel will be
                      saved, and all the Old Testament prophecies which were not
                      fulfilled during Christ’s first coming will be
                      accomplished.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      At the close of the Millennium, Satan will be loosed for a
                      short time to deceive the nations, but then will be
                      crushed forever by God.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The Great White Throne Judgment will occur, during which
                      all souls not raised before the Millennium will be judged,
                      resulting in eternal condemnation for those who failed to
                      establish a personal relationship with Jesus the Messiah.

                  <h3>Historic Premillennialism</h3>
                  <p>
                    This view is similar to Dispensational Premillennialism.
                    Historic Premillennialists believe that we are now in the
                    tribulation, which takes place over a long period of time.
                    Unlike the Dispensationalists they believe that the saints
                    will go through the tribulation, but will be shielded from
                    its most severe aspects. At the end of the tribulation the
                    Church will be raptured out to meet Christ in the air and
                    will at once return with Him to establish the Millennial
                    reign of Christ. Satan will be bound, and Christ will
                    possess absolute rule. The standard of the Sermon on the
                    Mount will prevail. The Historic Premillennialist places
                    considerably less emphasis on the nation of Israel and sees
                    many of the promises of God being fulfilled in spiritual
                    Israel— the Church. He does believe that the nation of
                    Israel will one day be saved.

                    A Survey of “things which must take place after this”:
                  </h3>
                  <p>(Taken from the Open Bible, Thomas Nelson Publishers)</p>
                  <p>
                    John is translated into heaven where he is given a vision of
                    the divine majesty. In it, the Father (“One sat on the
                    throne”) and the Son (The Lion/Lamb) are worshipped by the
                    twenty-four elders, the four leving creatures, and the
                    angelic host because of who they are and what they have done
                    (creation and redemption); Rev Ch 4 and 5.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Three cycles of seven judgments in chapters 6-16 consist of
                    seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls. There is a
                    prophetic insert between the sixth and seventh seal and
                    trumpet judgments and an extended insert between the trumpet
                    and bowl judgments. Because of the similarity of the seventh
                    judgment in each series, it is possible that the three sets
                    of judgments take place concurrently or with some overlap so
                    that they all terminate with the return of Christ. An
                    alternate approach views them as three consecutive series of
                    judgments, so that the seventh seal is the seven trumpets
                    and the seventh trumpet is the seven bowls.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The seven seals (6:1-8:5) include war, the famine and death
                    that are associated with war, and persecution. The prophetic
                    insert between the sixth and seventh seals describes the
                    protective sealing of 144,000 ‘children of Israel,’ 12,000
                    from every tribe. It also looks ahead to the multitudes from
                    every part of the earth who come ‘out of the great
                    tribulation.’ The catastrophic events in most of the trumpet
                    judgments are called ‘woes’ (8:2-11:19). The prophetic
                    interlude between the sixth and seventh trumpets adds more
                    details about the nature of the tribulation period and
                    mentions a fourth set of seven judgments (the ‘seven
                    thunders’), which would have extended it if they had not
                    been withdrawn. Two unnamed witnesses minister during three
                    and one-half years of the Tribulation (forty-two months or
                    1,260 days). At the end of their ministry they are overcome
                    by the Beast, but their resurrection and ascension confound
                    their enemies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chapters 12-14 contain a number of miscellaneous prophecies
                    that are inserted between the trumpet and bowl judgments to
                    give further background on the time of tribulation. In
                    Revelations Chapter 12, a woman gives birth to a male child,
                    who is caught up to God. The woman flees into the wilderness
                    and is pursued by the Dragon who is cast down to earth. Rev
                    13 gives a graphic description of the beast and his False
                    Prophet, both empowered by the dragon. The first beast is
                    given political, economic, and religious authority; and
                    because of his power and the lying miracles performed by the
                    second beast, he is worshiped as the ruler of the earth. Ch
                    14 contains a series of visions including the 144,000 at the
                    end of the tribulation, the fate of those who follow the
                    beast, and the outpouring of the wrath of God.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The seven bowl judgments of Revelations chapter 16 are
                    prefaced by a heavenly vision of the power, holiness, and
                    glory of god in Ch 15.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ch 17 and 18 anticipate the final down fall of Babylon, the
                    great harlot sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast.{" "}

                    The marriage banquet of the Lamb is ready and the King of
                    Kings, Lord of Lords leads the armies of heaven into battle
                    against the beast and his False Prophet. They are cast into
                    a lake of fire (Ch 19).{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In Ch 20, the Dragon-Satan-is bound for a thousand years. He
                    is cast into a bottomless pit. During this one thousand-year
                    period Christ reigns over the earth with His resurrected
                    saints, but by the end of this millennium, many have been
                    born who refuse to submit their hearts to Christ. At the end
                    of the thousand years, Satan is released and a final battle
                    ensues. This is followed by the judgment at the Great White
                    Throne.{" "}

                  <p>
                    A new universe is created, this time unspoiled by sin,
                    death, pain, or sorrow. The New Jerusalem, described in Rev
                    21:9 – 22:5, is shaped like a gigantic cube, 1,500 miles in
                    length, width and height (the Most Holy Place in the Old
                    Testament tabernacle and the temple was also a perfect
                    cube). Its multicolored stones will reflect the glory of
                    God, and it will continually be filled with light. But the
                    greatest thing of all is that believers will be in the
                    presence of God and “they shall see His face.”

                  <p>
                    Revelation concludes with an epilogue (22:6-21), which
                    reassures the readers that Christ is coming quickly (22:7,
                    12, 20) and invites all who wish to “take the water of life
                    freely” (22:17) to come to the alpha and Omega, the Bright
                    and Morning star.{" "}
