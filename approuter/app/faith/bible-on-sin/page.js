                    Cast off the works of darkness, walk properly, not in
                    drunkenness. Make no provision to fulfill the lusts of the

                  <p>
                    The Bible, of course, also warns of a coming world
                    government that will be based on evolutionary humanism, when
                    a great king “shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above
                    every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God
                    of gods.” Instead of acknowledging responsibility to the
                    Creator, he will “honor the God of forces” (Daniel 11:36,
                    38). The ultimate source of evolutionary humanism and all
                    its religious representatives, whether in ancient paganism
                    or modern scientism, is none other than Satan himself, the
                    old Dragon, who has been seeking since the beginning to
                    destroy the God of creation and become the cosmic deity
                    himself. For a brief moment Satanism will finally become the
                    world’s religion. “And they worshipped the dragon which gave
                    power to the beast: and they worshipped the beast ”
                    (Revelation 13:4).

                    Pornography attacks the dignity of men and women created in
                    the image of God. Pornography also distorts God’s gift of
                    sex which should be shared only within the bonds of
                    marriage. See 1 Cor. 7:2-3; Mathew 5:27-30; adultery (Lev.
                    18:20), bestiality (Lev. 18:23).

                  <p>
                    The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual
                    immorality, impurity and debauchery, idolatry and witchcraft
                    [which includes the use of drugs]; hatred, discord,
                    jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions,
                    factions, and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I
                    warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this
                    will not inherit the kingdom of God. In summary, the Bible
                    teaches us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
                    should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present
                    world. (Titus 2:12).

                  <p>
                    For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of

                    way of eternal life is straight and narrow (God’s way) –

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong> Love:</strong> Jesus said two commandments were
                      key: love God, and love your neighbor as yourself. (Matt.
                      22:37-40)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>A nation/society:</strong> The 10 Commandments Ex.
                      20:1-17
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Family:</strong> Ex 20:12 (honor parents), Deut.
                      6:4-9
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Man/Woman relationships:</strong> honor one
                      another, Eph. 5:1-21, I Peter 3:8-12, Prov. 31:3 sets
                      limits
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Marriage:</strong> Marriage is God’s idea from the
                      beginning. Sex is to be enjoyed, but only within the
                      boundaries of marriage. Outside of marriage? Choose now to
                      say no. Work to prevent finding yourself in awkward
                      situations. Example of David: should have been somewhere
                      else. (II Sam. 11:1); Gen. 2:18-25 (Adam and Eve), Heb.
                      13:4 (honor the marriage bed), Ecc. 9:9 (Enjoy), Prov.
                      5:15-19 (Be exhilarated), Prov. 31:10-31 (the excellent
                      wife), (I Peter 3:1-8—wives and husbands), Song of Songs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Purity:</strong> Dangers. Chose to say “Yes, to
                      God”. A. Proverbs has many stories of men (and women) who
                      make the wrong choice in their relationships. Prov.
                      5:1-14, 20-23, Prov. 6-27); B. Proverbs also has advice
                      for men and women who are making the right choice in their
                      relationship; Prov. 7:1-5 (wisdom and understanding keep
                      you on the right path), Prov. 31: 10-31(the excellent
                      wife)
                    </li>

                      <strong>
                        Difficult times we live in today – The Bad:
                      </strong>
                      II Tim. 3:1-9 The Good: II Tim. 3:10-17
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Temptation (and making choices)</strong> – I Cor.
                      10:13 (always a way of escape.) Avoid getting there in the
                      first place! Plan to succeed. The Bad: II Peter 1:9; The
                      Good: II Peter 1:2-8
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Identity and Purpose.</strong> Gen. 1:26-31 (men
                      and women’s unique mandate), II Pet. 1:10-11 (calling and
                      choosing), Phil. 3:12-14 (press on), I Cor. 15:10 (I live
                      by faith)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Relating to others:</strong> Love: Eph 5:1 (walk
                      in love), 1 Cor. 9:19-23 (relate that I may win some)
