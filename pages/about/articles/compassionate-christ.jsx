                                    <p>Jesus was moved with compassion when He saw the multitudes.  When His disciples drove away little children from approaching Jesus, He rebuked His disciples and permitted children to be brought to Him to be blessed.  He was a people-Person.  Out of His compassion for the broken hearted, Jesus said, “Come to me all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest1.”  While labor causes physical exhaustion, heaviness of heart causes mental fatigue and even spiritual deterioration.  But when you turn to Christ, He gives you hope, victory and joy.

                                    <h3>Turn to Christ

                                    </h3>
                                    <p>“Draw near to God and He will draw near to you2.”  David in his Psalm of confession said, “A broken and contrite heart – these O God, You will not despise3”.  “In this world you will have tribulations4”, Jesus said.  Solomon observed, “All things come alike to all; one event happens to the righteous and the wicked; to the good, the clean and the unclean; to him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice, as is the good, so is the sinner, he who takes an oath as he who fears an oath5.” There are two ways you can react to problems in life.  You can either turn bitter cursing God or turn to God who turns all sorrow into joy.  Too many Christians today are in self imposed exile in the valley of tears, instead of celebrating the joy of salvation.  “All because we do not carry everything to God in prayer”!

                                    <h3>Hope</h3>
                                    <p>A father brought his son who was afflicted by a mute spirit, to Jesus.  Whenever the evil spirit would seize the boy it would throw him down to ground, to fire and to water to destroy him.  The boy would foam at the mouth, gnash his teeth and become rigid.  He probably took his son to doctors, magicians and priests.  Yes, he took his son even to the disciples of Jesus.  No help came from any direction!  At this hopeless juncture, Jesus with great compassion said to him, “If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes6.” A man who was bedridden for 28 years had hope that one day he will get healed, at the Pool of Bethesda and finally received his healing from Jesus.  Hope abides! “Anyone who comes to Him must believe that he exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him7.”  One of the hopeless things in life is a prayer said without hope.  It is hope that keeps you from sinking into doubt.  Hope will enable you to say, “For His anger lasts only a moment, but His favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may remain for a night, but rejoicing comes in the morning8.”

                                    <p>Eve was tempted by the old serpent, Satan.  And so was Jesus in the wilderness.  You may be facing many temptations in your personal life or job.  It could be a war within you … a hard decision to be made for life.  While making the right choices in life can shape your destiny, it is not so easy when it comes to facing temptations.  “For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted.9” His help is found in the Bible, which is the sword of the Spirit.  We are told not to resist temptations, but be armed with the Scriptures and then resist the Devil and he will flee from you.  That was how Jesus confronted Satan’s lies and defeated his cunning schemes.

                                    <h3>Joy</h3>
                                    <p>The greatest sorrow on earth is bereavement due to the death of a loved one.  In the city of Nain, there was a widow who lost her only son, a young man.  A large crowd from the city was with her when they took the coffin towards the graveyard.  But that could not stop the tears of the mother going through unbearable bereavement.  Jesus had compassion on her and said to her “Do not weep10” It was a “sample” miracle to remind us of the fact of resurrection.  Sickness can bring us under the shadow of death.  Threat from enemies or hatred and rejection from one’s own family can bring us into the shadow of death or isolation.  “Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.11” If Jesus can deal with the worst of sorrow with a miracle, He can certainly help you to overcome sorrow, for He has promised, “I tell you the truth, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.12”

                                    </p>
                                    <p>Are you feeling restless, burdened with too many cares and concerns, with damaging effects on your health?  Jesus loves you enough and so He died for you.  As you go to Jesus in prayer this moment, He will record your tears and answer you.  Turn to Him.  Confess your sins and failures and receive His new life and compassion in faith.  He alone can bless you with undying hope, real victory and lasting joy.
