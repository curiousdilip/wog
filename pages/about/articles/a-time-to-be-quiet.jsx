                                    <p>In the business world, people strive to talk their way to success.  While it may be true, the more a man talks, the less he listens, much less learns.  King Solomon said, “To everything there is a season, a time for every purpose under heaven: … a time to keep silence and a time to speak.” (Ecclesiastes 3:1,7).  Being lost in a maze of activities, it is becoming impossible for man to observe silence on a regular basis.  “Quiet time” means the time spent consistently every day in self-isolation in a quiet and private ambience for the purpose of meditation of the Scriptures and prayer.  Psalmist unravels the secret of prosperity: “Blessed is the man … his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law he meditates day and night.  He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he does shall prosper.” (Psalm 1:2, 3).  Jesus’ life was punctuated with times of prayer.  “Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where He prayed.” (Mark 1:35). The most important relationship one can have in this life is with God and it is nourished and strengthened through daily mediation and prayer.

                                    <h3>Meditation</h3>
                                    <p>Meditation of the Scriptures quintessentially means reading and quietly contemplating truth that leads to understanding God, inner strength, calm and composure by the help of His Spirit.  This enables one to face trials, temptation, pressures and challenges of life, victoriously.  This is far different from what is talked about in recent times … transcendental meditation, Yoga, breathing exercise, thought orientation, thought conditioning, self-searching, eye rotation exercise, laughing exercise, chanting and several other strenuous and arcane methods of psychotherapy.  By reading the Bible and praying, many find the way of salvation, comfort in time of loneliness, mental relief in time of suffering, guidance when making vital decisions, protection in time of danger, courage in time of fear, peace in time of turmoil, rest in time of weariness, strength in time of temptation, warning in time of indifference and forgiveness in time of conviction.  The central theme of the Bible is God’s loving plan to rescue mankind.  Bible answers life’s greatest questions – Where did I come from? Why am I here? Where will I go?  It portrays what God is like – His thoughts, His plans and His promises for an individual. The Bible is celebrated as a traveler’s map, the pilgrim’s staff, the pilot’s compass, the soldier’s sword and the Christian’s charter.  The Gideons International advocate, “Read it to be wise, believed it to be safe, practice it to be holy.”

                                    <p>Psalmist says, ‘Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path; it gives understanding to the simple’ (Ps 119:105, 130).  Meditating on commandment of love, Biblical laws and instructions of Biblical writers, results in perfect understanding, spiritual satisfaction and health.  King Solomon admonishes, “My son, give attention to my words, and incline your ear to my saying.  Do not let them depart from your eyes; for they are life to those who find them and health to all their flesh.”  (Proverbs 4: 20-22)

                                    <h3>Prayer</h3>
                                    <p>Once a TV newsreader couple asked their child to pray before retiring to bed.  After uttering a few lines, she said, “Lord, here are the main points again.”  There are adults who doubt whether God listens at all.  ‘Prayer’ is a two-way communication – a request to God and listening to Him.  There are many kinds of prayers like … the Lord’s Prayer, confession prayer, intercessory prayer, invocation prayer, prayer of supplication, thanksgiving prayer, seasonal prayer, individual prayer, secret prayer, family prayer, fasting prayer, prayer of faith and public prayer.  Varying forms of postures, gestures, words, emotions accompany prayers.  The charismatic Christian prayer is said with much noise.  Congregations following ‘Old-time religion’, Orthodox and Catholic churches read or repeat written prayers week after week.   But prayer in some form is a vital part of Christian worship.  A praying man quits sinning and a sinner quits prayer.  For those who love God above all, prayer is certainly the refreshing breath of abundant life.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>The secret of prevailing prayer is praying in secret.  Jesus taught, “Go into your room, and when you have shut the door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.” (Mat 6:6).  The Bible commands,  “Watch and pray always.” (Luke 21:36); “Pray lest you fall into temptation.” (Mat 26:41); “Pray … that He sends labourers in to harvest (of souls).” (Luke 10:2); Pray for those in authority (1Tim 2:1,2); and Pray for your enemies (Luke 6:28).

                                    </p>
                                    <p>A prayer should be simple, not with many words, said with tenacity, importunity, intensity and confident expectation.  A prayer should have in-built: 1) adoration of God, 2) confession of our sins, 3) supplication of our needs, 4) interceding for others and 5) thanksgiving.  The criteria for prayers to be answered are: a) Purity of heart characterized by a forgiving spirit, humility and repentance; b) belief that God will answer; c) It should be said in Christ’s name; d) and subjected to God’s will.  Theologian Chrysostom writes: “The potency of prayer has subdued the strength of fire, it has bridled the rage of lions, hushed anarchy to rest, extinguished wars, appeased the elements, expelled demons, burst the chains of death, expanded the gates of heaven, assuaged disease, repelled frauds, rescued cities from destruction, stayed the sun in its course, and arrested the progress of the thunderbolt.  Prayer is an all-sufficient panoply, a treasure undiminished, a mine which is never exhausted, a sky unobscured by clouds, a heaven unruffled by the storm.  It is the root, the fountain, the mother, of a thousand blessings.” Observance of quiet time will speak volumes of success in one’s life.
