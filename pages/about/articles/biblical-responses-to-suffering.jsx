                                        We are getting acquainted with live news on deaths, loss of
                                        jobs, erosion of savings, loss of dignity, restrictions on
                                        movement, security threats or rumors of wars, mistrust on
                                        people, fear of the unknown, etc. These are some of the felt
                                        dimensions of a ‘new normal’ of a suffering humanity, during
                                        this global Pandemic. Otherwise, the old normal continues:
                                        human rights violations, food insecurity, street crimes,
                                        celebration of obscenity, loss of value for human life,
                                        public shaming or trolling, and disappointing governance and
                                        legal systems. The overarching consternation is that there
                                        has been too much freedom with too little responsibility;
                                        too much wealth with a few, with too little left for the
                                        rest of the world; too much power with a few over the
                                        vulnerable millions, with too little accountability; too
                                        many inventions with too little ethics and too many voices
                                        with too little truth! When we look at the Church, there is
                                        an apparent recklessness in teaching, with little or no
                                        focus on godliness and accountability. We wonder what is
                                        causing an erosion of trust and deterioration of peaceful
                                        co-existence. Furthermore, the frustrated millions ask: Why
                                        does God allows suffering? Can a loving and wise God permit
                                        even His children to suffer?{" "}

                                    <h3>I. PURPOSES OF SUFFERING</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The Bible has historical records of the sufferings of the
                                        righteous: Young Joseph was loathed by his brothers, sold
                                        into slavery, sorely tempted, falsely accused and
                                        imprisoned. Righteous Job’s oxen and donkeys were stolen,
                                        his farmhands killed, his sheep and herdsmen were burned by
                                        a mysterious fire, his camels were stolen and his servants
                                        killed; his sons and daughters died in a windstorm and Job
                                        himself was inflicted with boils. Prophet Jeremiah was
                                        persecuted by his own family, plotted against by his own
                                        town folks, rejected and ridiculed by his religious
                                        contemporaries, imprisoned, beaten and accused of treason.
                                        Apostle Paul was plotted against, stoned, left for dead,
                                        subjected to satanic buffeting, beaten and jailed at
                                        Philippi, ridiculed, and falsely accused. He endured violent
                                        storms at sea, was bitten by a venomous snake, and forsaken
                                        by all in front of a hostile crowd. The problem of suffering
                                        is a painful question for both a believer and an unbeliever.
                                        Whether one suffers rightly or wrongly, the principle of
                                        sowing and reaping can always be applied. However, the Bible
                                        shines the light on the subject of suffering with such
                                        clarity that it hardly needs profound interpretations.{" "}

                                            <strong>To Produce Fruit:</strong> Apostle Peter exhorted,
                                            ‘Suffering produces patience, joy, knowledge and maturity’
                                            (1 Peter 5:10a). James counsels, ‘Consider it pure joy, my
                                            brothers and sisters, and whenever you face trials of many
                                            kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith
                                            produces perseverance’ (James 1:2-3).{" "}

                                            <strong>To Silence the Devil:</strong>
                                            Every true believer will face frequent attacks from the
                                            Devil. It may come, with God’s permission or through
                                            blood-thirsty people who hate whatever is good or noble.
                                            Invariably, God’s intension is to silence the Devil. The
                                            Lord said to Satan, ‘Very well, then, everything he (Job)
                                            has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a
                                            finger’ (Job 1:12). Satan accused Job of serving God
                                            merely for material blessings. God permitted the devil to
                                            torment Job to demonstrate that His servant loved God
                                            because of who He was, and not for what Job could receive
                                            as blessings from Him.{" "}
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <strong>To Glorify God:</strong>Jesus answered to the
                                            question of human suffering thus: ‘Neither this (blind)
                                            man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that the
                                            works of God might be displayed in him’ (John 9:3).
                                            Suffering can bring glory to God, when a better outcome
                                            follows it. ‘Weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing
                                            comes in the morning’ (Psalm 30:5a).

                                            <strong>To Make Us Like Jesus:</strong> Paul suffered
                                            persecution for preaching Christ, yet, he makes it clear
                                            that his goal was: ‘to know Christ—yes, to know the power
                                            of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings,
                                            becoming like him in his death, and so, somehow, attaining
                                            to the resurrection from the dead’ (Philippians 3:10-11).
                                            Peter professes that the process of becoming like Christ
                                            in character is through suffering, saying, ‘For God called
                                            you to do good, even if it means suffering, just as Christ
                                            suffered for you. He is your example, and you must follow
                                            in his steps’ (1 Peter 2:21).

                                            <strong>To Teach Us Dependence:</strong> Man, left to his
                                            own devices, would only rattle down a decadent path of
                                            self-destruction, as he will ultimately face not only the
                                            problem of pain, but also the problem of pleasure and
                                            plenty. The world that was in an insane rush to save time
                                            and money, in order to redeploy it on pleasure and luxury,
                                            is now on a standstill, with irredeemable loss of time and
                                            money. Therefore, Jesus taught us to depend on His
                                            enabling grace, and guidance, saying, ‘apart from me you
                                            can do nothing’ (John 15:5c).{" "}

                                            <strong>To Refine Our Lives:</strong> King David, who even
                                            ran for his life from his pursuers, could comment on
                                            suffering with optimism thus: ‘For You, God, tested us;
                                            You refined us like silver. You brought us into prison and
                                            laid burdens on our backs. You let people ride over our
                                            heads; we went through fire and water, but You brought us
                                            to a place of abundance’ (Psalm 66:10-12).

                                            <strong>To Rebuke Our Sin:</strong> God is holy and His
                                            words are pure. Therefore, He disciplines an unruly and a
                                            disobedient child of His. The Bible instructs, ‘My son, do
                                            not make light of the Lord’s discipline, and do not lose
                                            heart when He rebukes you, because the Lord disciplines
                                            the one He loves, and He chastens everyone He accepts as
                                            His son’ (Hebrews 12: 5-6).

                                            Saint Paul explained suffering to the Corinthian church
                                            thus: ‘God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our
                                            troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with
                                            the comfort we ourselves receive from God’ (2 Corinthians

                                    <h3>II. RESPONSES TO SUFFERING</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Many tend to view the Bible as a mysterious jigsaw puzzle
                                        and dig out a truth here or interpret a prophecy there, just
                                        to suit their pre-existing convictions, gut feeling or
                                        temperaments. In these days, a babel of proverbial voices
                                        with Biblical overtones can be heard trying to make sense of
                                        any human suffering and its ravaging consequences.{" "}
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Let us suppose various takes of the verses, in the current
                                        context of global pandemic: The pious may note, ‘In that
                                        day,’ declares the Sovereign Lord, ‘I will turn your
                                        religious festivals into mourning and all your singing into
                                        weeping’ (Amos 8:10). Those with apocalyptic anticipations
                                        may caution, ‘for, in just a little while, He (Christ) who
                                        is coming will come and will not delay’ (Hebrews 10:37).
                                        Those relying on predestination may tend to calmly quote
                                        unmoved, ‘Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your
                                        wine with a joyful heart, for God has already approved what
                                        you do’ (Ecclesiastes 9:7). Those who stress on choice and
                                        freewill may attempt to, ‘Preach the word; be prepared in
                                        season and out of season’ (2 Timothy 4:2). Pessimists may
                                        rue, ‘I never sat in the company of revelers, never made
                                        merry with them; I sat alone because Your hand was on me and
                                        You had filled me with indignation’ (Jeremiah 15:17).

                                    <p>
                                        The cautious lot may stay safe, as per, ‘Go, my people,
                                        enter your rooms and shut the doors behind you; hide
                                        yourselves for a little while until His wrath has passed by’
                                        (Isaiah 26:20). Opportunists may swiftly cite: ‘When times
                                        are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider this:
                                        God has made the one as well as the other’ (Ecclesiastes
                                        7:14). The strong-willed may wax rhetorical saying, ‘Shall
                                        we accept good from God, and not trouble?’ (Job 2:10). Those
                                        judgmental may point out, ‘the eyes of the arrogant will be
                                        humbled and human pride brought low’ (Isaiah 2:11). The rich
                                        may keep partying with grace, celebrating amazing grace,
                                        with confidence on: ‘Then you … shall rejoice in all the
                                        good things the Lord your God has given to you and your
                                        household’ (Deuteronomy 26:11). Those who are philosophical
                                        may summarize, ‘Follow the ways of your heart and whatever
                                        your eyes see, but know that for all these things God will
                                        bring you into judgment’ (Ecclesiastes 11:9).

                                        Such divergent voices expose the unpreparedness of God’s
                                        people to face uncertainties ahead. For instance, let us
                                        consider some probable causes for collective suffering:
                                        social injustice, unreasonable restrictions on freedom of
                                        religion, systemic oppression, economic inequity, crimes,
                                        and callous disregard for sanctity of life. What can the
                                        children of God do to alleviate untold sufferings caused by
                                        such detrimental factors?

                                            <strong>Speak up for Social Justice:</strong> As
                                            deep-rooted evil clutches the world, the social order
                                            turns so demonic and self-destructive that we even fear
                                            the ultimate extinction of human race. Followers of Christ
                                            should strive to ‘Give justice to the weak and the
                                            fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the
                                            destitute’ (Psalm 82:3). Solomon admonishes, ‘Speak up for
                                            those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of
                                            all who are destitute’ (Proverbs 31:8). Denial of justice
                                            or delayed justice has inflicted untold sufferings on
                                            innocent lives. Their angst is unheeded and cries are
                                            unheard. God offers a plan of relief, saying: ‘If My
                                            people, who are called by My name, will humble themselves
                                            and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways,
                                            then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin
                                            and will heal their land’ (2 Chronicles 7:14).

                                            Nehemiah stood before King Artaxerxes and pleaded for a
                                            leave to rebuild the ruined walls of Jerusalem. The
                                            clarion call of Nehemiah was, ‘Come, let us rebuild the
                                            wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace’
                                            (Nehemiah 2:17). Under the leadership of Priest Ezra, ‘the
                                            people … celebrated the dedication of the house of God
                                            with joy’ (Ezra 6:16). As God’s people we are called to
                                            rebuild the walls of faith and morality, and set our own
                                            house in order and renew apostolic love and care for one
                                            another. Paul describes his suffering for the sake of the
                                            gospel, saying, ‘I am suffering even to the point of being
                                            chained like a criminal. But God’s word is not chained’ (2
                                            Timothy 2:9). To this effect, Paul always sought the
                                            prayers of his associates and congregations.{" "}

                                            should understand, that ‘The Lord detests dishonest
                                            scales, but accurate weights find favor with him’
                                            (Proverbs 11:1). An article of 2018 by Stephen Johnson, on
                                            the World Economic Forum’s website, cites the United
                                            Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, thus: ‘The
                                            annual costs of international corruption amount to a

                                            Solomon observed that even ‘the kindest acts of the wicked
                                            are cruel’ (Proverbs 12:10b). God alerted the Israelites
                                            saying, ‘The land you are entering to possess is a land
                                            polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By their
                                            detestable practices they have filled it with their
                                            impurity from one end to the other’ (Ezra 9:11). We need
                                            Ezras today to rekindle the moral senses of the society.
                                            Christ called us to be the salt and light of the world.{" "}

                                            happen after them?’ (Ecclesiastes 3:22). This brevity of
                                            life reminds us to be humble about our backgrounds,
                                            talents, possessions, beliefs, work and our future. The
                                            transient nature of events – good or bad, should only

                                    <p>
                                        The coin of suffering has two noteworthy sides. A suffering
                                        may be viewed as coming from God to bring out the best in
                                        us, for God’s glory. On the flip side, Satan may attempt to
                                        use the same temptation and suffering to bring out the worst
                                        in us, if we do not heed to respond according to Scriptures.
                                        A person of faith may suffer because of his position or his
                                        disposition. People may unwisely despise suffering and treat
                                        it too lightly and continue living with an incorrigible
                                        attitude. Or a person may get depressed by treating
                                        suffering too seriously and fall away from faith.{" "}

                                        A believer fully surrendered to God’s ways in his life, will
                                        stand to gain from suffering, as pure gold from the furnace
                                        of affliction. Paul observes, ‘For our light and momentary
                                        troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far
                                        outweighs them all’ (2 Corinthians 4:17) and further
                                        comforts us, saying, ‘And we know that in all things God
                                        works for the good of those who love him, who have been
                                        called according to his purpose’ (Romans 8:28).

                                        As God’s people, let us keep learning on towards spiritual
                                        maturity, knowing that the battles in life are not of flesh
                                        and blood, but of the spirit. The Bible declares, ‘The horse
                                        is prepared for the day of battle, but the victory belongs
                                        to the Lord’ (Proverbs 21:31). Assurance of that victory
                                        will render peace that passes understanding. For those who
                                        persevere in faith and prayer, the good news is, suffering
                                        is just for a season, as per St. Peter’s benediction: ‘God …
                                        after you have suffered a little while, will Himself restore
                                        you and make you strong, firm and steadfast’ (1 Peter 5:10).

                                    <p>Oh God, our help in ages past</p>
