                                    <p>Famed Hollywood comedian Robin Williams, who was called the ‘funniest man on earth,’ committed suicide due to acute depression.  Several others in the entertainment industry have ended their lives abruptly, despite all the fun that the world could offer them and all the thrilling sensation they could be to the world. Here’s why we wonder why peace is so elusive and so costly.  To attain peace of mind, people may try anything– workaholic lifestyle, wealth, entertainment, cheap popularity, pleasure, alcohol, aesthetic living, addictive shopping, wanderlust, meditation techniques, secretive societies etc. At last, nobody seems to exclaim ‘life is sweet!’  Puzzled enough, the human mind despondently rues:  Where is peace?  Is there a sure way to it? How do I get there? We are only echoing what Solomon said centuries ago: ‘All things are full of weariness; a man cannot utter it; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.’ (Ecclesiastes 1:18)

                                    <h3>The Cause of Conflict:

                                    </h3>
                                    <p>Several years ago, I read of an elderly Italian couple, who had never spoken with each other for over five decades, though they were living under the same roof!  The Mayor of that little town attempted to broker peace between them on their 60th wedding anniversary, but couldn’t succeed.  It is pride that remembers the hurt long enough.  Pastors or elders may recall how they had counselled some estranged couples to reconsider their marital vows and reconcile.  Alas, pride would not let the couple even try it!  Pride is the quintessential brand of wickedness.  The Bible plainly states, ‘Pride leads to conflict.’ (Proverbs 13:10)   ‘There is no peace,’ says the Lord, ‘for the wicked.’ (Isaiah 48:22)  ‘The way of peace they do not know, and there is no justice in their paths; they have made their roads crooked; no one who treads on them knows peace.’ (Isaiah 59:8)

                                    </p>
                                    <p>Disunity is plaguing the church like never before!  It is not uncommon to see these days, that police protection is sought for security of worshippers, partly because the congregation is at war within itself, leave alone persecution, which is not new to Christendom!  Legal advisors, property managers, election commissioners and auditors are more hallowed functionaries of Christian institutions than the ‘simpletons’ who labour with the Word of God.   C.S. Lewis in his Reflections on the Psalms observed, ‘If the Divine call does not make us better, it will make us very much worse. Of all bad men religious bad men are the worst. Of all created beings the wickedest is one who originally stood in the immediate presence of God.’

                                    </p>
                                    <p>Global peace has been an unresolved question for ages for thinkers, religious leaders and rulers.  Increasingly, countries are re-aligning themselves at far ends of contentious political spectrum for want of territorial hegemony, religious authority, oil or other natural resources.  It appears like the new world order, whatever it may emerge to be, may not deliver the ultimate expectation of humanity – peace.   Apostle Paul prophetically warned, ‘While people are saying, “There is peace and security,” then sudden destruction will come upon them as labour pains come upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.’ (1Thessalonians 5:3)

                                    </p>

                                    <h3>The Source of Peace:

                                    </h3>
                                    <p>In a world of hatred and retaliation, Gandhi observed, ‘An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.’  Law demands punishment and retribution.  Human nature is vindictive and vengeful. Therefore, peace is not free!  Jesus paid an exorbitant cost for it, by His own death on the Cross, to atone for sins of humanity, thereby appeasing the anger of a righteous God, who could not see sin unpunished.  The Bible says ‘(Jesus) reconciled to Himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of His cross.’ (Colossians 1:20)  Therefore, Paul observed, ‘since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.’ (Romans 5:1)   Psalmist David sang, ‘May the Lord bless his people with peace!’ (Psalm 29:11)   Jesus is called the ‘Prince of Peace’ because ‘He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on Him.’ (Isaiah 53:5)   Graciously did Jesus declare, ‘Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.’ (John 14:27)  To the woman who touched the edge of Jesus’ garment in faith for her healing, He told her, ‘Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.’ (Luke 8:48)

                                    </p>
                                    <p>Men and women of God for ages have lived and died in perfect peace, in spite of untold miseries, war, famine, sickness, bereavement, loss, and loneliness. Their peace passes our understanding, as they hung to a silver line in dark clouds, hard for us to identify. The Bible assures, ‘And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.’ (Philippians 4:7)  As we turn our eyes upon Jesus, our hearts and minds are miraculously enabled to be attuned to His guidance and comfort enough to bear the fruit of the Spirit, which is ‘love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness.’ (Galatians 5:22)

                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <h3>The Path of Peace:

                                    </h3>
                                    <p>When Nelson Mandela was realised from prison after 27 years, there was jubilation worldwide.  However, civil strife within South Africa was escalating, with majority blacks wishing to take over political power from the whites with a view to settle scores through reverse-discrimination.  At that pivotal point in its national history, Mandela had to make a choice – that mind should take over emotions and firmly observed, ‘If you want to make peace with your enemy, you have to work with your enemy. Then he becomes your partner.’  He thereafter created Truth and Reconciliation Commission to improve multi-racial relations. It took a man who suffered 27 years of oppression and discrimination to bring hope to a nation that might have otherwise witnessed a violent bloodbath!  When leaders lead the people with God-given wisdom, there will be peace. ‘During Solomon’s lifetime Judah and Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, lived in safety, everyone under their own vine and under their own fig tree.’ (1 Kings 4:25)

                                    </p>
                                    <p>Solomon, a keen observer of human life for a lifetime, authentically states, ‘When people’s lives please the Lord, even their enemies are at peace with them.’ (Proverbs 16:7)   When Israelites bowed to Prophet Samuel’s leadership, there was peace.  ‘The cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath, and Israel delivered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. There was peace also between Israel and the Amorites.’ (1 Samuel 7:14)

                                    </p>
                                    <p>Peace is accessible to people of faith – who believe on the Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour and follow His sermon on the mount.  Isaiah prayed, ‘You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You.’ (Isaiah 26:3)  Pages of human history are full of innocent blood, shed since the time of Cain!  Jerusalem has been the most embattled place on earth, even as enemy nations seek to over run it.  God is mighty to grant peace and the world will one day witness it.  God promises, ‘Nevertheless, the time will come when I will heal Jerusalem’s wounds and give it prosperity and true peace.’ (Jeremiah 33:6)

                                    </p>

                                    <h3>The Pursuit of Peace:

                                    </h3>
                                    <p>American media proprietor and talk show host, Oprah Winfrey, on a recent visit to Mumbai, was surprised to visit a family where member of four generations of that family were living under a single roof.  She remarked how religious Indians were, as she saw in some houses a traditional worship (Puja) room.  On the flip side, Christian family values in urban India are deteriorating.  As in the West, infidelity, live-in relationships, divorce, teen rebellion, new age religious practices, etc., are being accepted as liberated ways of living.   Such permissiveness is just a step away from self-destruction of society itself.  Christian marriage is one where both partners necessarily win by forgiving each other.  Otherwise, both lose!  Conflict and reconciliation are not like choices over a restaurant menu, but a product of either diabolical rebellion from or humble surrender to God’s law of love.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>The world, including some Christians has been hypocritical.  Apostle James noticed it promptly – ‘and one of you says to them (the poor), “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that?’ (James 2:16)  The pursuit of peace involves a lifestyle of care and compassion towards those in need. To such generous souls, the Bible promises, ‘Blessed is the one who considers the poor! In the day of trouble the Lord delivers him.’ (Psalm 41:1)  The Bible admonishes us to pursue peace.  Paul’s fatherly admonition to young Timothy was this: ‘flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.’ (2 Timothy 2:22)  Here’s an encouraging advice from American writer Kent M Keith, as found in his poem, Paradoxical commandments:

                                    </p>
                                    <p>People are illogical, unreasonable, and self-centred. Love them anyway.<br />
                                        If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives. Do good anyway.<br />
                                        If you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies. Succeed anyway.<br />
                                        The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow. Do good anyway.<br />
                                        Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable. Be honest and frank anyway.<br />
                                        The biggest men and women with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest men and women with the smallest minds. Think big anyway.<br />
                                        People favour underdogs but follow only top dogs. Fight for a few underdogs anyway.<br />
                                        What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight. Build anyway.<br />
                                        People really need help but may attack you if you do help them. Help people anyway.<br />
                                        Give the world the best you have and you’ll get kicked in the teeth. Give the world the best you have anyway.</p>
                                    <p>Apostle Paul admonished early Christians, saying ‘let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual up-building.’ (Romans 14:19)  To a highly contentious, disunited, and immoral Corinthian Church, Paul wrote, ‘Dear brothers and sisters, I close my letter with these last words: Be joyful. Grow to maturity. Encourage each other. Live in harmony and peace. Then the God of love and peace will be with you.’ (2 Corinthians 13:11 NLT)  The secret is: if you pursue God, you unknowingly pursue peace as well!
