                                    <p>
                                        Jesus said to him, I am the Way and the Truth and the Life;
                                        no one comes to the Father except by (through) Me. (John
                                        14:6)
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        And they answered, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ [give
                                        yourself up to Him, take yourself out of your own keeping
                                        and entrust yourself into His keeping] and you will be
                                        saved, [and this applies both to] you and your household as
                                        well. (Acts 16:31)

                                        Because if you acknowledge and confess with your lips that
                                        Jesus is Lord and in your heart believe (adhere to, trust
                                        in, and rely on the truth) that God raised Him from the
                                        dead, you will be saved. (Romans 10:9)

                                        1THE LORD is my Shepherd [to feed, guide, and shield me], I
                                        shall not lack. 2He makes me lie down in [fresh, tender]
                                        green pastures; He leads me beside the still and restful
                                        waters. 3He refreshes and restores my life (my self); He
                                        leads me in the paths of righteousness [uprightness and
                                        right standing with Him–not for my earning it, but] for His
                                        name’s sake. 4Yes, though I walk through the [deep, sunless]
                                        valley of the shadow of death, I will fear or dread no evil,
                                        for You are with me; Your rod [to protect] and Your staff
                                        [to guide], they comfort me. 5You prepare a table before me
                                        in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil;
                                        my [brimming] cup runs over. 6Surely or only goodness,
                                        mercy, and unfailing love shall follow me all the days of my
                                        life, and through the length of my days the house of the
                                        Lord [and His presence] shall be my dwelling place. (Psalm
                                        23)
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Fear not [there is nothing to fear], for I am with you; do
                                        not look around you in terror and be dismayed, for I am your
                                        God. I will strengthen and harden you to difficulties, yes,
                                        I will help you; yes, I will hold you up and retain you with
                                        My [victorious] right hand of rightness and justice. (Isaiah
                                        41:10)
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        5Let your character or moral disposition be free from love
                                        of money [including greed, avarice, lust, and craving for
                                        earthly possessions] and be satisfied with your present
                                        [circumstances and with what you have]; for He [God] Himself
                                        has said, I will not in any way fail you nor give you up nor
                                        leave you without support. [I will] not, [I will] not, [I
                                        will] not in any degree leave you helpless nor forsake nor
                                        let [you] down (relax My hold on you)! [Assuredly not!] 6So
                                        we take comfort and are encouraged and confidently and
                                        boldly say, The Lord is my Helper; I will not be seized with
                                        alarm [I will not fear or dread or be terrified]. What can
                                        man do to me? (Hebrews 13:5-6)

                                        3Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
                                        the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, 4who
                                        comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort
                                        those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have
                                        received from God. 5For just as the sufferings of Christ
                                        flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort
                                        overflows. (2 Cor. 1:3-5)

                                    <p>
                                        8Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from
                                        me. 9But He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for
                                        my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will
                                        boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that
                                        Christ’s power may rest on me. 10That is why, for Christ’s
                                        sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in
                                        persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am
                                        strong. (2 Cor. 12:8-10)
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        3Consider Him who endured such opposition from sinful men,
                                        so that you will not grow weary and lose heart. 4In your
                                        struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point
                                        of shedding your blood. 5And you have forgotten that word of
                                        encouragement that addresses you as sons: “My son, do not
                                        make light of the Lord’s discipline, and do not lose heart
                                        when he rebukes you, 6because the Lord disciplines those he
                                        loves, and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son.”
                                        7Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as sons.
                                        For what son is not disciplined by his father? 8If you are
                                        not disciplined (and everyone undergoes discipline), then
                                        you are illegitimate children and not true sons. 9Moreover,
                                        we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we
                                        respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the
                                        Father of our spirits and live! 10Our fathers disciplined us
                                        for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines
                                        us for our good, that we may share in his holiness. 11No
                                        discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later
                                        on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and
                                        peace for those who have been trained by it. 12Therefore,
                                        strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees. 13″Make level
                                        paths for your feet,” so that the lame may not be disabled,
                                        but rather healed. (Hebrews 12:3-13)

                                        given to him. 6But when he asks, he must believe and not
                                        doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea,
                                        blown and tossed by the wind. (James 1:5-6)

                                        fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day, 6
                                        nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the
                                        plague that destroys at midday. 7 A thousand may fall at
                                        your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not
                                        come near you. 8 You will only observe with your eyes and
                                        see the punishment of the wicked. 9 If you make the Most
                                        High your dwelling— even the LORD, who is my refuge- 10 then
                                        no harm will befall you, no disaster will come near your
                                        tent. 11 For he will command his angels concerning you to
                                        guard you in all your ways; 12 they will lift you up in
                                        their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a
                                        stone. 13 You will tread upon the lion and the cobra; you
                                        will trample the great lion and the serpent. 14 “Because he
                                        loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue him; I will protect
                                        him, for he acknowledges my name. 15 He will call upon me,
                                        and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will
                                        deliver him and honor him. 16 With long life will I satisfy
                                        him and show him my salvation.” (Psalms 91)

                                        5Let your character or moral disposition be free from love
                                        of money [including greed, avarice, lust, and craving for
                                        earthly possessions] and be satisfied with your present
                                        [circumstances and with what you have]; for He [God] Himself
                                        has said, I will not in any way fail you nor give you up nor
                                        leave you without support. [I will] not, [I will] not, [I
                                        will] not in any degree leave you helpless nor forsake nor
                                        let [you] down (relax My hold on you)! [Assuredly not!] 6So
                                        we take comfort and are encouraged and confidently and
                                        boldly say, The Lord is my Helper; I will not be seized with
                                        alarm [I will not fear or dread or be terrified]. What can
                                        man do to me? (Hebrews 13:5-6)
                                    </p>

                                        10Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.
                                        11Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your
                                        stand against the devil’s schemes. 12For our struggle is not
                                        against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the
                                        authorities, against the powers of this dark world and
                                        against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
                                        13Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the
                                        day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and
                                        after you have done everything, to stand. 14Stand firm then,
                                        with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the
                                        breastplate of righteousness in place, 15and with your feet
                                        fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of
                                        peace. 16In addition to all this, take up the shield of
                                        faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows
                                        of the evil one. 17Take the helmet of salvation and the
                                        sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 18And pray in
                                        the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and
                                        requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on
                                        praying for all the saints. (Ephesians 6: 10-18)

                                        12Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because
                                        when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of
                                        life that God has promised to those who love him. 13When
                                        tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God
                                        cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; 14but
                                        each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is
                                        dragged away and enticed. 15Then, after desire has
                                        conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is
                                        full-grown, gives birth to death. 16Don’t be deceived, my
                                        dear brothers. (James 1:12-16)

                                        6Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from
                                        setting our hearts on evil things as they did. 7Do not be
                                        idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: “The
                                        people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in
                                        pagan revelry.” 8We should not commit sexual immorality, as
                                        some of them did—and in one day twenty-three thousand of
                                        them died. 9We should not test the Lord, as some of them
                                        did—and were killed by snakes. 10And do not grumble, as some
                                        of them did—and were killed by the destroying angel. 11These
                                        things happened to them as examples and were written down as
                                        warnings for us, on whom the fulfillment of the ages has
                                        come. 12So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful
                                        that you don’t fall! 13No temptation has seized you except
                                        what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let
                                        you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are
                                        tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can
                                        stand up under it. (1 Cor.10:6-13)

                                        7But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
                                        fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his
                                        Son, purifies us from all sin. 8If we claim to be without
                                        sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9If we
                                        confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive
                                        us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. (1 John
                                        1:7-9)
