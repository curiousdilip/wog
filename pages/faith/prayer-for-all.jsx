                                    <p>(Compiled by Dr. Richard PhD)</p>
                                    <p>Our loving Heavenly Father,</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Your Word says, “For if we confess our sins, he is faithful
                                        and just to forgive our sins and cleanse us of all
                                        unrighteousness”. So I come to You today, to You, the God of
                                        forgiveness. I know through Jesus’ shed blood I can be
                                        forgiven. I thank You that when You see me that You pass
                                        over me for You see me through Jesus’ blood and You are
                                        moved to mercy, grace, and forgiveness and not judgment as I
                                        deserve. I confess my sin of ____________________________. I
                                        also ask You to show me when I’ve sinned and am not aware of
                                        it. Lord, I wait on You.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Now, Lord, come and fill me with Your Spirit. I thank You
                                        for cleansing me, forgiving me, and loving me. I know I am
                                        clean because of the word You have spoken. I know I am
                                        forgiven because I have trusted in Jesus’ blood. I know I am
                                        loved for You have shown me Your love at the cross of Jesus
                                        Christ. So Father, I now need to be filled with Your Spirit
                                        of Grace, Love, and Power to overcome the world, myself, and
                                        the devil. Come Lord, and fill me from the top of my head to
                                        the bottom of my feet. Come Lord, and fill my heart with
                                        You.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I believe You are filling me right now. I wait on You and
                                        receive the Power of Your Holy Spirit over sin. I believe
                                        You are filling me right now. I trust that You will give me
                                        Power over my sinful nature, over temptation, and over the
                                        wiles of the devil. I praise You. I worship You. I give You
                                        glory for what You are doing in me and throughout me. I
                                        thank You and will praise You forever in Jesus’ Name I pray.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Amen.</p>

                                    <h3>2. A Prayer for those in sorrow and sickness</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        You healed all who came to you for healing and you comforted
                                        the broken-hearted. You even raised the dead and restored
                                        people back to their families. The woman who had twelve
                                        years of bleeding sickness touched Your garment and was
                                        healed instantly. Your Word of authority and grace brought
                                        healing to Centurion’s servant. Lord in this time of sorrow
                                        and sickness, surrounded by enemies or inimical germs and
                                        viruses attacking me, I cry out in pain and distress, for
                                        your divine mercy and healing. Your word says that we are
                                        healed by your stripes, because our sins were borne by you
                                        on the cross for us and You died in our place to pay the
                                        penalty for our sins and resurrected the third day to be
                                        alive forevermore to watch over us. Lord, forgive my sins
                                        and bless me with new life, new health and new hope and a
                                        new chapter in life. Please refresh and rebuild all that is
                                        broken in my body, as I believe you body was broken for my
                                        healing and peace. Lord, remember the days that are being
                                        wasted due to this sickness, pain and depression. Please
                                        remember the unnecessary medical expenditure. If you heal
                                        me, I can spare that money for the poor widow and orphans.
                                        Lord, heal me now and take me out of this sick bed, so that
                                        I will remain fruitful, productive and be a blessing to
                                        others. I believe you are powerful to do that. I pray in
                                        your name, Lord Jesus. Amen

                                        times of trouble. You are aware of every part of my

                                        lack of money and my debt.

                                        Lord, you see my mind and emotions filled with the heavy
                                        burdens of unpaid bills and rising debt. Lord, you see it
                                        all. Nothing has escaped your gaze. I come asking for you to
                                        bring your loving intervention in my finances. Show me how
                                        to get out of every financial mess in my life. Teach me how
                                        to bring my finances into a healthy place. Guide me in each
                                        financial decision that I make. Give me a vision of
                                        debt-free living that will motivate me and propel me to that
                                        blessed place of financial peace. Father, thank you for
                                        every good gift you give to me. Thank you for the favor that
                                        you are giving me to bring me opportunities for increased
                                        income. Thank you for the protection that you are providing
                                        for me so that I will not have as many unexpected bills.
                                        Thank you for the emotional stability that you are growing
                                        in me to gain more contentment in my daily life and more
                                        self-control in my spending and saving. I thank you for your
                                        favor, your wisdom, your mercy, and your protection. I pray
                                        this prayer of faith and may it not go vain, because I ask
                                        this prayer in the mighty name of Jesus, my Lord and
                                        Saviour. Amen.

                                        Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good

                                        I feel lost and overwhelmed. The world seems out of control,
                                        full of evil. Life has become a nightmare. Please help me
                                        remember that you made this world and declared it good. Give
                                        me the comfort of your presence and the confidence to trust
                                        you even when nothing seems to change. Calm my mind, bring
                                        peace to my heart and strengthen my spirit to carry on in
                                        the midst of loss. Lay a path for me, and help me follow
                                        your way as I move forward. Loving Father, When you called
                                        your beloved Son Jesus to be your Anointed Messenger, you
                                        allowed him to be tested in the desert, and to experience
                                        victory over the evil none. Enable us to conquer
                                        temptations, as we seek to serve you. The temptations of
                                        power, influence and self-assertion: to succumb to pride and
                                        to manipulate those in our care. The temptations of greed,
                                        sex and laziness: to gratify impulses and to treat people as
                                        objects; the temptations of money, property and wealth and
                                        to be jealous of others. The temptations that lead us to
                                        evil addictions of alcohol, drugs and tobacco: to surrender
                                        our self control and to maltreat loved ones among us. Send
                                        your Holy Spriit into our hearts and minds our bodies and
                                        our souls, so that we may be conformed to the image of Jesus

                                        Open their spirits to the in-filling of the Holy Spirit,

                                        God, our loving Heavenly Father! Your Scripture says,
                                        “Children are a heritage from the Lord, the fruit of the
                                        womb is Your reward.” The Scripture also describes how You
                                        answered the cries of Hannah and blessed her with a son, who
                                        became an exceptional leader and prophet. You have promised
                                        in Your Scriptures, saying, “You may ask Me for anything in
                                        My name, and I will do it.”
                                    </p>

                                        Heavenly Father, do mercifully remember my anxiety,
                                        loneliness and yearnings due to prolonged waiting for the
                                        blessing of a child! I pour out my tears and heart’s longing
                                        in Your loving Presence, O God. May my sorrows turn into joy
                                        and my humiliation into an exclusive delight of being a
                                        mother! Grant my spouse and myself, renewal of health and
                                        make our married life complete and meaningful. Forgive our
                                        shortcomings as parents and remove whatever curse or
                                        obstacle that is hindering this blessing in our lives. Bless
                                        us with a sweet child, Lord, very soon.{" "}

                                    <p>Loving Heavenly Father,</p>
                                    <p>
                                        I come to You with the assurance that You are a
                                        prayer-answering God! Yes Lord! Your Word says that You are
                                        merciful and You never cast away those who come to You
                                        (Matthew 11:28). So I bow before You and offer this prayer
                                        with faith and confidence that You’ll answer my prayer,
                                        because You love me very much.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Lord! Please forgive all my shortcomings and take full
                                        control of my life from now on.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Even now, You know the anxieties within me concerning my
                                        forthcoming exams. Master! It is nothing for You to help
                                        those with power or without power (2 Chronicles 14:11). I
                                        cannot achieve anything in this world on my own.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        So please fill my heart and soul with Your divine presence
                                        and be the Lord of my life. Please take away all my
                                        weaknesses, remove all deviations and deceptions, break
                                        every obstacle and help me to fully concentrate in my
                                        studies with peace. (1 Corinthians 15:10; Micah 2:13; Isaiah
                                        58:11).

                                        Now, I look up to You and beg You to fill my heart with Your
                                        wisdom and knowledge to learn my lessons (James 1:5). Help
                                        me to prepare well for my exams. Give me understanding and
                                        strong memory power. Help me to cover all the portions and
                                        enable me to face my exams boldly.
                                    </p>

                                        Let Your compassionate eyes be always upon me, as You have
                                        promised, to instruct me and guide me in my studies. You
                                        have also promised that You are always with me wherever I go
                                        (Isaiah 41:10). So be with me even in the exam hall. Hold my
                                        hand so that I would write the correct answer for each
                                        question. Grant me favour in the eyes of the examiners who
                                        value my papers and help me to get excellent marks.

                                        I commit my exams and my future into Your hands. I claim
                                        victory in Your mighty name because the battle is Yours and
                                        Yours alone (Proverbs 21:31).

                                        from the bottom of my heart and granting me victory. I

                                    <p>
                                        Lord, you are the source of all wisdom and fountain of all
                                        knowledge. You created all that we see in nature with your
                                        wisdom. Your word instructs us that if anyone lacks wisdom,
                                        he should ask of God, who gives liberally. Help us to follow
                                        You, with reverence and fear and keep ourselves away from
                                        evil. There are deceptions in this world that we are unable
                                        to discern the right from the wrong and choose the path of
                                        life instead of the one that leads to destruction. Lord,
                                        grant me with me an instructed tongue, to know the word that
                                        sustains the weary. Awaken me morning by morning, my ear to
                                        listen like one being taught. Guide me out of the darkness
                                        and uncertainty that surrounds me and lead me into all
                                        truth. Lord, though I may not know what my tomorrow holds
                                        for me, I believe You and repose my faith in You, as You
                                        know my entire life on earth. Guide me from the deceptions
                                        of riches, temptations of lust, cares of this world and the
                                        confusion arising out of human voices around and lead me
                                        beside still waters and green pastures, and satisfy my soul.
                                        I pray this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen

                                        in a secular job. You did deign to bless Your servants, our
                                        forefathers David, Joseph, Daniel and others that they
                                        should continue to have close communion with you in their

                                        for them. You did grant them high status in their vocations.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        My God, grant me Your peace, which the world cannot give, in
                                        my mind, in my workspot and in my domestic life. Only than
                                        can I pursue my duties heartily and with diligence and
                                        concentration. Grant me good physical health and strength.
                                        Deliver me from the hands of all that hate me and plan to do
                                        me harm out of jealousy. Grant me grace that I may not feel
                                        indignant and annoyed, when I meet them, but rather that I
                                        may have the power ad the temperament to forgive them and
                                        love them. Grant me a heart that would pray for them. May I
                                        find grace and favour in the eyes of those placed above me
                                        in station and those who are subordinate to me. Guard my
                                        lips that they speak no slander no words of impatience and
                                        anger. Help me to be truly an ideal employee knowing that my
                                        Master is in Heaven.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Help me, O Lord, that however hard pressed I am at my
                                        work-spot, I may not fail in my duties to my friends, my
                                        relatives and my loved ones. Also help me to gladly assist
                                        those who stand in need of my guidance and aid in my
                                        workspot. You did sojourn in this world as One who was doing
                                        good. You learned the discipline of daily work in the
                                        carpenter’s shop in Nazareth. Open my eyes, ears and heart,
                                        to see, hear and accept your mission in the place where I
                                        work. Guard my relationship with those around me. Among them
                                        may I be your chosen servant: an agent of reconciliation
                                        where there is strife, a defender of Justice where there is
                                        unfairness, and a bringer of compassion where there is
                                        unhappiness. Teach me when to speak and when to listen, when
                                        to act and when to wait, as your disciple in the power of
                                        the Spirit. Oh my God, who have assured me saying, ‘Lo, I am
                                        with you always, even unto the end of the world’, abide with
                                        me all through this day and bless the labours of my hands. I
                                        thank and praise You that You are doing this for me. I pray
                                        this in Jesus’ Name, with thanksgiving. Amen.
                                    </p>
